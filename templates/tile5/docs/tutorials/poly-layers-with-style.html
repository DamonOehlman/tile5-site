This tutorial follows on from the [Poly Layers Introduction](poly-layers-intro) tutorial, as we look
to make our poly layers actually look *good*.  In the previous tutorial, poly(gon/line)s were drawn with a 
solid black outline with a white fill (if the fill initialization parameter was set) and this looks
pretty bland.  Time to give these layers some style.

Styles in Tile5 are stored in a simple external javascript file, but can also be parsed in from external 
JSON(P) sources. In our tutorial here, if you have a look at the code, you see an additional include for
[/media/js/tutorials/styles.js](/media/js/tutorials/styles.js) file.

At this stage, no dynamic attributes can be configured within the styles, but if this is
an important feature to people then it could be investigated.  If you are, however, defining a style and then 
including it via `script` tag, then you could likely use some nifty canvas tricks such as `createPattern' to 
create some more interesting fill effects.

Anyway, enough hypotheticals on with the sample code :)

<div class="note">
This tutorial is currently using the <a href="http://github.com/sidelab/tile5">Tile5 master branch</a>, as the poly functionality does 
not work correctly in version 0.9.3
</div>

In this next sample we modify our example from the [Poly Layers Introduction](poly-layers-intro) and specify 
a `style` parameter when initializing the new T5.PolyLayer using the `area.parkland` style from the 
[PDXAPI Demo](http://sandbox.tile5.org/samples/pdxapi).

You should see now that our poly is filled using a semi-transparent green colour.  Styles can be applied to any one of 
the T5.PolyLayer or T5.Poly or T5.Geo.UI.Poly classes.  Essentially, the style that is given to the T5.PolyLayer will be used
unless an *override* is specified for a particular layer, in which case that will be used instead.

This is demonstrated in the sample below.

Hopefully that serves as a bit of introduction of where we are headed with styles in Tile5. As noted above though the 
feature is not yet available in the [latest stable version](/downloads), and it would be great if you have some specific 
requirements or thoughts around styles that [join the Tile5 group](http://groups.google.com/group/tile5) and discuss 
things there.  If you are keen to give things a try before it hits a release, head on over to the 
[github repository](http://github.com/sidelab/tile5) and grab a copy.
