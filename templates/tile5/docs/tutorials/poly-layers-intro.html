Poly layers are still a little experimental, but they are coming along pretty nicely (as 
can be seen in our [PDXAPI sample](http://sandbox.tile5.org/samples/pdxapi).  This tutorial
will provide an introduction on how to use poly layers in a Tile5 application.

<div class="note">
This tutorial is currently using the <a href="http://github.com/sidelab/tile5">Tile5 master branch</a>, as the poly functionality does 
not work correctly in version 0.9.3
</div>

In this first example, we will draw a simple rectangle over our map.  Note that the `prepareMap` 
function call in the first line of the code is simple used to set the position of the map, and 
remove the test poly layer if it exists so we can perform the demo.

<pre class="prettyprint" id="simpleRectangle"></pre>

Now, in the above example there is a fair bit of redundancy with regards to parsing positions 
over and over again.  So just as there is a T5.GeoVector class, there is also a T5.Geo.UI.Poly 
class that makes creating poly(gon/line)s for positions simpler. 

<pre class="prettyprint" id="simpleRectangleGeopoly"></pre>

This demonstrates using poly layers in a very simple way, but as you would have seen if you ran
the sample code the poly that is created is very bland (white fill, black border) and definitely
not something that would make for a very attractive map or visualization.

As such, we are introducing styles in Tile5 to help make using poly layers useful.  We have also worked
through existing layer types and replaced any initialization parameters specifying stroke or fill styles
with a general style parameter.

For more information on using styles, continue on to the [Poly Layers with Style](poly-layers-with-style) tutorial.
