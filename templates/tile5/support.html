<h2>Community Support</h2>
<p>
Tile5 is an <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a> product, licensed under the 
liberal <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT-licence</a> to ensure 
maximum flexibility.  As such, building and supporting a support community is our primary goal.
<a href="http://www.sidelab.com/">Sidelab Australia</a> is committing one full-time resource 
(plus one part-time) to monitor community feedback and help that grow.
</p>
<p>
Free support will be offered via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tile5/">mailing list</a> - 
check out the information on the <a href="/community">community page</a> for further details.
</p>
<h2>Custom Development Services</h2>
<p>
In addition to support services, <a href="http://www.sidelab.com/">Sidelab</a> is looking to partner
with forward thinking companies to integrate Tile5's open mapping (and more) into their products and/or
organisation.  Tile5 (amongst other products) opens up a myriad of opportunities for both to 
leverage OpenSource mapping to create competitive advantage or reduce current spend around mapping 
technologies.
