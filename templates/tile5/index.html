<p>
Tile5 is an opensource HTML5 javascript library that provides developers a foundation for 
building tile-based application interfaces.  
<p>
<a href="/mapping">Tile5 Maps</a> is an extension library (also opensource) that makes 
cross-device <a href="/demos/mapping/">HTML5 maps</a> possible. 
</p>
<h2>Device Compatibility</h2>
<p>
Tile5 is targeted at both mobile and desktop browsers that support HTML5. 
Our long-term goal is to achieve compatibility with all mobile devices considered 
"Class A" on the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/">jQuery Mobile GBS chart</a>, 
as well as modern desktop browsers (including IE once Microsoft get their act
together).
