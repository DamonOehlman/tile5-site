<p>
The objective of the Tile5 mapping library is simple: <strong>Offer
cross-device HTML5 mapping that feels <em>as good as</em> a native device 
implementation on any device that supports HTML5.</strong>
</p>
<p>
This objective is not one that will be realised overnight, but as
the quality and power of mobile devices improves so to will Tile5.  Right now,
the performance and features of Tile5 HTML5 mapping on an iPhone 3GS 
(or greater) offers a comparable experience to those of the native maps.
</p>
<h2>Multiple Map Providers</h2>
<p>
Tile5 has been built from the ground-up to be a vendor neutral implementation. With the number 
of map provider and mobile device combinations being very high, a native device implementation for each
provider is unsustainable.
</p>
<p>
This was one of the primary design decisions for choosing a technology
such as HTML5, and it was important to also ensure that Tile5 provided suitable extension points for
"plugging in" as many mapping providers as possible.  We believe this will providing a sustainable solution
for businesses interested in implementing location based services.

<h2>What about OpenLayers?</h2>
<p>
A question that comes up every now and again, is why was Tile5 built rather than 
getting involved with and using <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>?
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://twitter.com/DamonOehlman">My</a> reasons for building
Tile5 rather than using something like OpenLayers were the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The main project I was working on required serving tiles and routes from 
		<a href="http://decarta.com/">deCarta</a> DDS and from my research no
		DDS + OpenLayers integration seems to be publicly available.  As to why I 
		didn't use deCarta's JS API?  Well that brings me to my next point.</li>
	<li>Tile5 has first and foremost built for <a href="/device-compatibility-roadmap">mobile devices</a>
		with HTML5 desktop browsers being a secondary goal.  Handling touch events (including multitouch)
		was critical as I saw Tile5's competition as the many different native mobile 
		mapping APIs available.  Not the established desktop JS APIs.</li>
	<li>Because I was designing for mobile and HTML5, I had the opportunity to leave all the "bloat" 
		(read IE6 support) that other established libraries might be subjected to behind.  Plus
		I could focus on <a href="http://distractable.net/coding/getting-the-foundation-right/">javascript
		performance and UX</a> over the multitude of GIS features that existing libraries support. <br />
		<em>I wanted to rattle a sabre at the native APIs as if to say "your time will be up soon".  
		I hope I did that.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
So you see, it's not really about choosing between Tile5 and something like 
OpenLayers.
</p>
<p>If you are 
building a web application and you have to cater for IE support, then your choice is simple - use
<a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>.  If, however, you are thinking about building a mobile app and want to make your app work on
more than just one device and eventually get a desktop web app for free, then I don't think you can
go past Tile5.  Just my opinion, and feel free to let me know yours :)
