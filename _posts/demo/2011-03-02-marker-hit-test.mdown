This demo showcases a new feature of `0.9.4.2` around the ability to detect hovering over markers.  Previously the marker layer of a map would capture and report tapping a marker through the `markerTap` event, this method will be deprecated in favor of more generic hit method reported at the `T5.View` layer.  

__NOTE:__ Marker hit testing not yet implemented in 3D.
