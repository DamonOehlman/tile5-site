This demo showcases a new feature of `0.9.4.2` around the ability to detect hovering over markers.  Previously the marker layer of a map would capture and report tapping a marker through the `markerTap` event, this method will be deprecated in favor of more generic hit method reported at the `T5.View` layer.  

The implementation isn't 100% decided yet, but something along the lines of `hoverHit` and a `tapHit` or possibly a single event that reports the hitType via a parameter (preferences?).
