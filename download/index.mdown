The latest version of the Tile5 Beta is `0.9.4.2` and this is used to power all the demos on this site.  Additionally, the `0.9.3.1` release is also available for download and does have some features that have temporarily been removed from the `0.9.4` branch.

We'd certainly encourage you to use the latest version, but if things such as inertial scrolling are really important to you right now, then you may want to opt for `0.9.3`.
