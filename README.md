This is a Jekyll Site template that is designed to enable you to create a simple desktop site that also looks good on mobile devices.  The main piece of work that has gone on here is around customization of a menu that basically aligns to the top of the page for desktop display.

When the screen hits a certain width, the menu will disappear and will be activated by a "Menu" button.  This reveals the menu in a more mobile-like navigation menu.
