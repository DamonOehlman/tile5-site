<p>
Displayed below are the roadmapped releases of Tile5 for the next few months.
</p>

<p>
Items from each of the releases are fed from the
<a href="https://github.com/sidelab/tile5">Tile5 Github Repository</a> so if there is
something in particular you are chasing then please consider raising the request in the 
<a href="https://github.com/sidelab/tile5/issues">Issue Tracker</a> and we look at when such 
a request could be implemented.
</p>

<h2>0.9.5</h2>
<p>
This will be the next release of Tile5.  It focuses on adding the ability
to drag markers and path and also support hover events for desktop browsers.
Additionally, we will be starting to test Internet Explorer compatibility 
via <a href="http://flashcanvas.net/">Flash Canvas</a> in this release.

A maintenance release of <code>0.9.5</code> that will look to restore some of the more
